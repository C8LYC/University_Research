## recommend using git to pull, push, and other version control commed.
You can dowwnload git (*needed*) and TortoiseGit (*Optional, just graphical user interface (GUI) tool for git*) and all git setting has in the project, so you don't need to set the project. That is , you can just do "commit","pull" and "push" at most of time. **Please make sure that you are not changing the same part with your partner because we may not have too much time to do complex merge.**
